The name of our application is "SYP" or Select Your Podcast.

The basic function of our application is to let the user search for podcasts by name or genre (e.g. "Star Wars", "Movies") and provide links to the podcasts that match their search criteria. It will also provide book recommendations and links to purchase those books on the google store.

The site also has a featured tab that provides a variety of curated podcasts the user can choose from.

The site uses the Listen Notes and Google Books APIs.
